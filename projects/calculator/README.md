# etch-a-sketch

Implemenetation of The Odin Project's [calculator assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

Mostly complete, I have not:

1. Implemented any kind of display overflow handling
1. Implemented any extra credit exercises

These might be informative, but I'd rather invest the time in new concepts.
