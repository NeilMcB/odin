[![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/NeilMcB/odin/main.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/NeilMcB/odin/main)

Monorepo for tracking progress through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard).

## Structure

Mostly still TBD.

Projects can be found in the `projects` folder.

Exercise repos are "forked" into directiories under `exercises`.

A readymade boilerplate page with a linked script for exploring JavaScript is available under `scratch`.

## TODO

1. Once setup with `npm`, run the following checks locally and with CI; currently just running via VSCode extensions:
    1. [HTMLHint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htmlhint)
    1. [W3C Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/w3c-html-validator)
    1. [stylelint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint)
    1. [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
2. Run tests with CI
